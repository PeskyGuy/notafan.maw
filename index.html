            <h2>why is my scroll acting weird again</h2>
            <p class="date">tuesday??? maybe wednesday</p>
            <p>
                ok so LISTEN. the <span class="emphasis">Church</span> people keep saying they talk to the gods right???
                the whole
                Pantheon of Embrace thing. but like. HAVE YOU SEEN THEM ACTUALLY DO IT. because i haven't. i've been
                doing magic
                for like 40 years and i've never seen a single priest cast a real spell. suspicious much???
            </p>
            <p>
                also there's NINE MILLION PEOPLE HERE. nine. million. in Vyrodin. and somehow the fancy districts have
                like
                zero crime and my neighborhood had THREE robberies last week. the math isn't mathing. they say it's an
                <span class="emphasis">open secret</span> that the Church is corrupt but like if everyone knows then why
                are we
                pretending??? make it make sense
            </p>
            <p>
                AND ANOTHER THING. where did the Heroes of Union go??? Archmage Minoph just FOUNDED THIS WHOLE CITY and
                then
                POOF gone. all of them. <span class="emphasis">Missing</span>. right when the Church took over.
                that's not weird to anyone else???? just me???? ok cool cool cool

            <h2>the scroll situation is getting out of hand</h2>
            <p class="date">definitely thursday now</p>
            <p>
                so the M.A.W. right. the Mass Arcane Web. AMAZING invention. even people with zero magic can use their
                Arcslates
                to message anyone anywhere. revolutionary. game changing. i love it
            </p>
            <p>
                BUT. and this is a big but. we have <span class="emphasis">free communication</span> but like... do we
                though???
                because my friend Torvik said something about the Church being "financially questionable" on his scroll
                last month
                and now his Arcslate "mysteriously broke" and he can't afford a new one. WEIRD RIGHT
            </p>
            <p>
                they're watching. i know they're watching. every message. every M.A.W. connection. they say it's for
                "peace"
                because Ohsa had all those conflicts for centuries and now we finally have peace. but is it really peace
                if
                you're scared to say what you think??? asking for a friend. that friend is me. i'm asking for me

            <h2>THOUSANDS OF YEARS FOR THIS???</h2>
            <p class="date">lost track of time honestly</p>
            <p>
                ok so Vyrodin is like <span class="emphasis">thousands of years old</span>. THOUSANDS. that's a lot of
                years.
                i can barely remember what i had for breakfast and this city has been here for MILLENNIA. and what do we
                have
                to show for it??? a theocracy that treats faith like a subscription service. "oh you want to live here?
                better be loyal to the Pantheon or else"
            </p>
            <p>
                i'm old enough to remember before the Church ran everything. yeah Ohsa was messy. conflicts everywhere.
                but at least i could <span class="emphasis">choose</span> things??? now it's all "mandatory faith" this
                and
                "loyalty oath" that. miss one blessing ceremony and suddenly you're a heretic. A HERETIC. for sleeping
                in.
                ridiculous
            </p>
            <p>
                everyone just accepts it too!!! they're like "oh but we have peace now" and i'm like DO WE THOUGH.
                because last i checked the outer districts are basically lawless wastelands while the Church district
                has guards every five feet. that's not peace that's just ignoring half the city

            <h2>wizard registration is a SCAM</h2>
            <p class="date">friday? or maybe still thursday</p>
            <p>
                they want me to REGISTER my magic. like it's a pet or something. "oh please sir Church sir can i please
                do the magic i've been studying for decades???" <span class="emphasis">Obedience</span> they call it.
                i call it CONTROL
            </p>
            <p>
                report your research. attend the ceremonies. bow and scrape and pretend like they're doing us a favor.
                i can cast spells that would make their heads spin (not literally) (well maybe literally) (i haven't
                tried)
                and they want me to ask PERMISSION???
            </p>
            <p>
                what would Archmage Minoph think huh??? the person who FOUNDED THIS CITY. probably rolling in their
                mysterious disappearance grave. the Heroes of Union didn't vanish for this. they vanished because
                they saw what was coming and noped out. smart honestly
            </p>
            <p>
                Vyrodin is just a big monument to <span class="emphasis">hypocrisy</span> now. "city of unity" they call
                it.
                more like city of "do what we say or suffer"

            <h2>connecting dots that probably shouldn't be connected but HEAR ME OUT</h2>
            <p class="date">time is a construct anyway</p>
            <p>
                the crime in the bad districts??? INTENTIONAL. keep everyone fighting each other and they won't notice
                the Church owns like half the city. it's genius in an evil way. diabolical even
            </p>
            <p>
                my Arcslate keeps glitching when i type certain words. "corrupt" makes it freeze. "theocracy" makes it
                restart. coincidence??? I THINK NOT. they're in the M.A.W. watching everything. hi Church people reading
                this. your robes look silly
            </p>
            <p>
                anyway i'm just a wizard. doing wizard things. definitely not criticizing the government. just
                observing.
                making observations. very normal wizard observations about how everything is suspicious and nothing
                makes sense
            </p>
            <p>
                if this is my last post it's because my scroll "broke" like Torvik's. or i "moved away suddenly".
                or i "decided to join a monastery". none of which are things i would do. so if you see that you'll know
            </p>
            <p>
                ok i need to go. i think i heard something. probably nothing. definitely nothing. just the wind.
                in my apartment. on the fifth floor. with all the windows closed. totally normal wizard paranoia
